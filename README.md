# ComposerExample

This is only example project for article on my blog.
You can read the whole post - [What is and how to use Composer](http://en.juffalow.com/what-is-and-how-to-use-composer/).

## Extended version

I wrote next post () so this project now includes new changes. It should not be a problem, because you can test composer on this version as well. If you do want to download the origin project, it is still available through [this commit](https://github.com/juffalow/ComposerExample/tree/431ec3f4464ff5e966b22e4b543fa6556b4af1bc).
